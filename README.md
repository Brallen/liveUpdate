**Live Update**  
This website updates the css in real time by inserting css into a style element and a pre element. It was based on an idea by Jake Albaugh.   
  
Use npm install to get all the needed packages then use npm start to create a server defaulted to port 3000. npm run clean will remove the extra js files created.
